2. Click Add repository.

![alt text](image/image-1.png)

3. Select Create new repository and click Continue.

![alt text](image/image-2.png)

4. Name the repository `devops-repo`.

5. Select your current project ID from the list.

6. Click Create.

![alt text](image/image-3.png)

7. Click Cloud Console, and in the new tab click Activate Cloud Shell.

![alt text](image/image-4.png)

8. If prompted, click Continue.

9. Enter the following command in Cloud Shell to create a folder called `gcp-course`:

```bash
mkdir gcp-course
```

10. Change to the folder you just created:

```bash
cd gcp-course
```

![alt text](image/image-5.png)

11. Now clone the empty repository you just created. If prompted, click Authorize:

```bash
gcloud source repos clone devops-repo
```

> Note: You may see a warning that you have cloned an empty repository. That is expected at this point.

12. The previous command created an empty folder called devops-repo. Change to that folder:

```bash
cd devops-repo
```

![alt text](image/image-6.png)

### 2. Create a simple Python application

1. In Cloud Shell, click Open Editor (Editor icon) to open the code editor.

2. Select the gcp-course > devops-repo folder in the explorer tree on the left.

3. Click on devops-repo.

4. Click New File.

5. Name the file `main.py` and press Enter.

6. Paste the following code into the file you just created:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def main():
    model = {"title": "Hello DevOps Fans."}
    return render_template('index.html', model=model)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=8080, debug=True, threaded=True)
```

7. To save your changes. Press CTRL + S.

8. Click on the `devops-repo` folder.

9. Click New Folder.

10. Name the folder `templates` and press Enter.

11. Right-click on the `templates` folder and create a new file called `layout.html`.

12. Add the following code and save the file as you did before:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>{{model.title}}</title>
    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css"
    />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="container">
      {% block content %}{% endblock %}

      <footer></footer>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
```

13. Also in the `templates` folder, add another new file called `index.html`.

14. Add the following code and save the file as you did before:

```js
{% extends "layout.html" %}
{% block content %}
<div class="jumbotron">
  <div class="container">
    <h1>{{model.title}}</h1>
  </div>
</div>
{% endblock %}
```

15. In Python, application prerequisites are managed using pip. Now you will add a file that lists the requirements for this application.

16. In the `devops-repo` folder (not the templates folder), create a New File and add the following to that file and save it as `requirements.txt`:

```bash
Flask>=2.0.3
```

![alt text](image/image-8.png)

![alt text](image/image-9.png)

![alt text](image/image-10.png)

![alt text](image/image-11.png)

17. You have some files now, so save them to the repository. First, you need to add all the files you created to your local Git repo. Click Open Terminal and in Cloud Shell, enter the following code:

```bash
cd ~/gcp-course/devops-repo
git add --all
```

18. To commit changes to the repository, you have to identify yourself. Enter the following commands, but with your information (you can just use your Gmail address or any other email address):

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

19. Now, commit the changes locally:

```bash
git commit -a -m "Initial Commit"
```

![alt text](image/image-12.png)

20. You committed the changes locally, but have not updated the Git repository you created in Cloud Source Repositories. Enter the following command to push your changes to the cloud:

```bash
git push origin master
```

![alt text](image/image-13.png)

21. Refresh the `Cloud Source Repositories` web page. You should see the files you just created.

![alt text](image/image-14.png)

### 3. Define a Docker build

The first step to using Docker is to create a file called `Dockerfile`. This file defines how a Docker container is constructed. You will do that now.

1. Click `Open Editor`, and expand the `gcp-course/devops-repo` folder. With the `devops-repo` folder selected, click New File and name the new file `Dockerfile`.

The file Dockerfile is used to define how the container is built.

2. At the top of the file, enter the following:

```bash
FROM python:3.9
```

3. Enter the following:

```bash
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
```

These lines copy the source code from the current folder into the /app folder in the container image/image.

4. Enter the following:

```bash
RUN pip install gunicorn
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Enter the following:

```bash
ENV PORT=80
CMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 main:app
```

6. Verify that the completed file looks as follows and save it:

```bash
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install gunicorn
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
ENV PORT=80
CMD exec gunicorn --bind :$PORT --workers 1 --threads 8 main:app
```

### 4. Manage Docker images with Cloud Build and Artifact Registry

The Docker image/image has to be built and then stored somewhere. You will use Cloud Build and Artifact Registry.

1. Click Open Terminal to return to Cloud Shell. Make sure you are in the right folder:

```bash
cd ~/gcp-course/devops-repo
```

2. The Cloud Shell environment variable DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID automatically has your current project ID stored. The project ID is required to store images in Artifact Registry. Enter the following command to view your project ID:

```bash
echo $DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID
```

3. Enter the following command to create an Artifact Registry repository named devops-repo:

```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create devops-repo \
    --repository-format=docker \
    --location="REGION"
```

4. To configure Docker to authenticate to the Artifact Registry Docker repository, enter the following command:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker "REGION"-docker.pkg.dev
```

5. To use Cloud Build to create the image/image and store it in Artifact Registry, type the following command:

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag "REGION"-docker.pkg.dev/$DEVSHELL_PROJECT_ID/devops-repo/devops-image/image:v0.1 .
```

![alt text](image/image-18.png)

6. On the Google Cloud console title bar, type Artifact Registry in the Search field, then click Artifact Registry in the Products & Pages section.

7. Click on the Pin icon next to Artifact Registry.

8. Click devops-repo.

![alt text](image/image-19.png)

9. Click devops-image/image. Your image/image should be listed.

![alt text](image/image-20.png)

![alt text](image/image-21.png)

10. On the Google Cloud console title bar, type Cloud Build in the Search field, then click Cloud Build in the Products & Pages section.

![alt text](image/image-22.png)

11. Click on the Pin icon next to Cloud Build.

12. Your build should be listed in the history.

You will now try running this image/image from a Compute Engine virtual machine.

13. On the Navigation menu, click Compute Engine > VM Instance.

![alt text](image/image-23.png)

14. Click Create Instance to create a VM.

15. On the Create an instance page, specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

| Property              | Value                                                                                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Container             | Click DEPLOY CONTAINER                                                                          |
| Container image/image | '`Lab Region`-docker.pkg.dev/`Project ID`/devops-repo/devops-image/image:v0.1` and click SELECT |
| Firewall              | Allow HTTP traffic                                                                              |

16. Click Create.

17. Once the VM starts, click the VM's external IP address. A browser tab opens and the page displays `Hello DevOps Fans`.

![alt text](image/image-28.png)

> Note: You might have to wait a minute or so after the VM is created for the Docker container to start.

18. You will now save your changes to your Git repository. In Cloud Shell, enter the following to make sure you are in the right folder and add your new Dockerfile to Git:

```bash
cd ~/gcp-course/devops-repo
git add --all
```

19. Commit your changes locally:

```bash
git commit -am "Added Docker Support"
```

20. Push your changes to Cloud Source Repositories:

```bash
git push origin master
```

![alt text](image/image-29.png)

21. Return to Cloud Source Repositories and verify that your changes were added to source control.

9. To test the trigger, click Run and then Run trigger.

![alt text](image/image-37.png)

![alt text](image/image-38.png)

10. Click the History link and you should see a build running. Wait for the build to finish, and then click the link to it to see its details.

![alt text](image/image-39.png)

11. Scroll down and look at the logs. The output of the build here is what you would have seen if you were running it on your machine.

12. Return to the Artifact Registry service. You should see a new image/image in the devops-repo > devops-image/image folder.

13. Return to the Cloud Shell Code Editor. Find the file main.py in the gcp-course/devops-repo folder.

14. In the main() function, change the title property to "Hello Build Trigger." as shown below:

```py
@app.route("/")
def main():
    model = {"title":  "Hello Build Trigger."}
    return render_template("index.html", model=model)
```
