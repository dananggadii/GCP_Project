# Cloud Run

### 1. Enable the Cloud Run API and configure your Shell environment

1. From Cloud Shell, enable the Cloud Run API :

```bash
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com
```

2. If you are asked to authorize the use of your credentials, do so. You should then see a successful message similar to this one:

![alt text](image/image.png)

> Note: You can also enable the API using the APIs & Services section of the console.

3. Set the compute region:

```bash
gcloud config set compute/region "REGION"
```

4. Create a LOCATION environment variable:

```bash
LOCATION="Region"
```

### 2. Write the sample application

1. In Cloud Shell create a new directory named helloworld, then move your view into that directory:

```bash
mkdir helloworld && cd helloworld
```

2. Next you'll be creating and editing files. To edit files, use nano or the Cloud Shell Code Editor by clicking on the **Open Editor** button in Cloud Shell.

3. Create a package.json file, then add the following content to it:

```bash
nano package.json
```

```json
{
  "name": "helloworld",
  "description": "Simple hello world sample in Node",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "author": "Google LLC",
  "license": "Apache-2.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1"
  }
}
```

4. Press CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter to save the package.json file.

5. Next, in the same directory, create an index.js file, and copy the following lines into it:

```bash
nano index.js
```

```js
const express = require("express");
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 8080;

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const name = process.env.NAME || "World";
  res.send(`Hello ${name}!`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`helloworld: listening on port ${port}`);
});
```

This code creates a basic web server that listens on the port defined by the PORT environment variable. Your app is now finished and ready to be containerized and uploaded to Artifact Registry.

6. Press CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter to save the index.js file

> Note: You can use many other languages to get started with Cloud Run. You can find instructions for Go, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, Shell scripts, and others from the [Quickstarts guide](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts).

### 3. Containerize your app and upload it to Artifact Registry

1. To containerize the sample app, create a new file named Dockerfile in the same directory as the source files, and add the following content:

```bash
nano Dockerfile
```

```bash
# Use the official lightweight Node.js 12 image/image.
# https://hub.docker.com/_/node
FROM node:12-slim

# Create and change to the app directory.
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy application dependency manifests to the container image/image.
# A wildcard is used to ensure copying both package.json AND package-lock.json (when available).
# Copying this first prevents re-running npm install on every code change.
COPY package*.json ./

# Install production dependencies.
# If you add a package-lock.json, speed your build by switching to 'npm ci'.
# RUN npm ci --only=production
RUN npm install --only=production

# Copy local code to the container image/image.
COPY . ./

# Run the web service on container startup.
CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

2. Press CTRL+X, then Y, then Enter to save the Dockerfile file.

3. Now, build your container image/image using Cloud Build by running the following command from the directory containing the Dockerfile. (Note the $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT environmental variable in the command, which contains your lab's Project ID):

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld
```

Once pushed to the registry, you will see a SUCCESS message containing the image/image name (gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/helloworld). The image/image is stored in Artifact Registry and can be re-used if desired.

4. List all the container images associated with your current project using this command:

```bash
gcloud container images list
```

5. Register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported Docker registries:

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker
```

> Note: You may be prompted Do you want to continue? (y/N)? if you are, enter Y to agree.

6. To run and test the application locally from Cloud Shell, start it using this standard docker command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld
```

7. In the Cloud Shell window, click on Web preview and select Preview on port 8080.

This should open a browser window showing the "Hello World!" message. You could also simply use curl localhost:8080.

### 4. Deploy to Cloud Run

1. Deploying your containerized application to Cloud Run is done using the following command adding your Project-ID:

```bash
gcloud run deploy --image/image gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld --allow-unauthenticated --region=$LOCATION
```

The allow-unauthenticated flag in the command above makes your service publicly accessible.

2. When prompted confirm the `service name` by pressing Enter.

> Note: You may be prompted Do you want enable these APIs to continue (this will take a few minutes)? (y/N)? if you are, enter Y to enable the API needed.

Wait a few moments until the deployment is complete.

On success, the command line displays the service URL:

### 5. Clean up

1. You can either decide to delete your Google Cloud project to avoid incurring charges, which will stop billing for all the resources used within that project, or simply delete your helloworld image/image using this command :

```bash
gcloud container images delete gcr.io/$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT/helloworld
```

2. When prompted to continue type Y, and press Enter.

3. To delete the Cloud Run service, use this command :

```bash
gcloud run services delete helloworld --region="REGION"
```

4. When prompted to continue type Y, and press Enter.
