> Note: Installing an RDP client on your local machine is outside the scope of this lab and of the class. For this reason, you will not be connecting to the Windows VM during this lab. However, you will step through the usual procedures up to the point of requiring the RDP client. Instructions for connecting to Windows VMs are in the [Connecting to Windows VMs Guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/connecting-to-windows?hl=id).

Set the password for the VM

1. Click on the name of your Windows VM to access the VM instance details.

2. You don't have a valid password for this Windows VM: you cannot log in to the Windows VM without a password. Click Set Windows password.

> Note: You will not connect to the Windows VM during this lab. However, the process would look something like the following (depending on the RDP client you installed). The RDP client shown can be installed for Chrome from the [Chrome webstore](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/chrome-rdp-for-google-clo/mpbbnannobiobpnfblimoapbephgifkm?hl=en-US). On the VM instances page, you would click RDP for your Windows VM and connect with the password copied earlier.

Before connecting using Desktop IAP, ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- You have configured the VPC to [allow IAP traffic to the VM instance](https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/using-tcp-forwarding?hl=id#create-firewall-rule).
- You have downloaded and installed [IAP Desktop on your local computer](https://googlecloudplatform.github.io/iap-desktop/?utm_source=cloud.google.com).
