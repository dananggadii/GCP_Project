# Cloud Storage

### 1. Preparation

Create a Cloud Storage bucket

1. On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.

2. Click Create.

3. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

| Property                                        | Value                                                                               |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name                                            | Enter a globally unique name                                                        |
| Location                                        | type Region                                                                         |
| Region                                          | REGION                                                                              |
| Enforce public access prevention on this bucket | unchecked                                                                           |
| Access control                                  | Fine-grained (object-level permission in addition to your bucket-level permissions) |

4. Make a note of the bucket name. It will be used later in this lab and referred to as [BUCKET_NAME_1].

5. Click Create.

Download a sample file using CURL and make two copies

1. In the Cloud Console, click Activate Cloud Shell (Cloud Shell).

2. If prompted, click Continue.

3. Store [BUCKET_NAME_1] in an environment variable:

```bash
export BUCKET_NAME_1=<enter bucket name 1 here>
```

4. Verify it with echo:

```bash
echo $BUCKET_NAME_1
```

5. Run the following command to download a sample file (this sample file is a publicly available Hadoop documentation HTML file):

```bash
curl \
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/\
hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/\
ClusterSetup.html > setup.html
```

6. To make copies of the file, run the following commands:

```bash
cp setup.html setup2.html
cp setup.html setup3.html
```

### 2. Access control lists (ACLs)

Copy the file to the bucket and configure the access control list

1. Run the following command to copy the first file to the bucket:

```bash
gcloud storage cp setup.html gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/
```

2. To get the default access list that's been assigned to setup.html, run the following command:

```bash
gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl.txt
cat acl.txt
```

3. To set the access list to private and verify the results, run the following commands:

```bash
gsutil acl set private gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html
gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl2.txt
cat acl2.txt
```

4. To update the access list to make the file publicly readable, run the following commands:

```bash
gsutil acl ch -u AllUsers:R gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html
gsutil acl get gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html  > acl3.txt
cat acl3.txt
```

Examine the file in the Cloud Console

1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Cloud Storage > Buckets.

2. Click [BUCKET_NAME_1].

3. Verify that for file setup.html, Public access has a Public link available.

Delete the local file and copy back from Cloud Storage

1. Return to Cloud Shell. If necessary, click Activate Cloud Shell (Cloud Shell).

2. Run the following command to delete the setup file:

```bash
rm setup.html
```

3. To verify that the file has been deleted, run the following command:

```bash
ls
```

4. To copy the file from the bucket again, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud storage cp gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup.html setup.html
```

### 3. Customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK)

Generate a CSEK key

1. Run the following command to create a key:

```bash
python3 -c 'import base64; import os; print(base64.encodebytes(os.urandom(32)))'
```

Result (this is example output):

2. Copy the value of the generated key excluding b' and \n' from the command output. Key should be in form of ``

Modify the boto file

1. To view and open the boto file, run the following commands:

```bash
ls -al
nano .boto
```

2. Locate the line with `#encryption_key=`

3. Uncomment the line by removing the # character, and paste the key you generated earlier at the end.

Example (this is an example):

4. Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the boto file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

Upload the remaining setup files (encrypted) and verify in the Cloud Console

1. To upload the remaining setup.html files, run the following commands:

```bash
gsutil cp setup2.html gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/
gsutil cp setup3.html gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/
```

2. Return to the Cloud Console.

3. Click [BUCKET_NAME_1]. Both setup2.html and setup3.html files show that they are customer-encrypted.

Delete local files, copy new files, and verify encryption

1. To delete your local files, run the following command in Cloud Shell:

```bash
rm setup*
```

2. To copy the files from the bucket again, run the following command:

```bash
gsutil cp gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup* ./
```

3. To cat the encrypted files to see whether they made it back, run the following commands:

```bash
cat setup.html
cat setup2.html
cat setup3.html
```

### 4. Rotate CSEK keys

Move the current CSEK encrypt key to decrypt key

1. Run the following command to open the .boto file:

```bash
nano .boto
```

2. Comment out the current encryption_key line by adding the # character to the beginning of the line.

3. Uncomment decryption_key1 by removing the # character, and copy the current key from the encryption_key line to the decryption_key1 line.

Result (this is example output):

4. Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the boto file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

Generate another CSEK key and add to the boto file

1. Run the following command to generate a new key:

```bash
python3 -c 'import base64; import os; print(base64.encodebytes(os.urandom(32)))'
```

2. Copy the value of the generated key excluding b' and \n' from the command output. Key should be in form of `tmxElCaabWvJqR7uXEWQF39DhWTcDvChzuCmpHe6sb0=`.

3. To open the boto file, run the following command:

```bash
nano .boto
```

Uncomment encryption and paste the new key value for `encryption_key=`.

Result (this is example output):

5. Press Ctrl+O, ENTER to save the boto file, and then press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

Rewrite the key for file 1 and comment out the old decrypt key

1. Run the following command:

```bash
gsutil rewrite -k gs://$BUCKET_NAME_1/setup2.html
```

2. To open the boto file, run the following command:

```bash
nano .boto
```

3. Comment out the current decryption_key1 line by adding the # character back in.

Result (this is example output):
