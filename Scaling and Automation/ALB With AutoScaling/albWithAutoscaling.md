# Configure an Application Load Balancer with Autoscaling

![alt text](image.png)

### 1. Configure a health check firewall rule

Health checks determine which instances of a Application Load Balancer (HTTP) can receive new connections. The health check probes to your load-balanced instances come from addresses in the ranges 130.211.0.0/22 and 35.191.0.0/16. Your firewall rules must allow these connections.

#### Create the health check rule

Create a firewall rule to allow health checks.

1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click VPC network > Firewall.
   Notice the existing ICMP, internal, RDP, and SSH firewall rules.

2. Each Google Cloud project starts with the default network and these firewall rules.

3. Click Create Firewall Rule.

6. Click Cloud Router, and select Create new router.

7. For Name, type nat-router-us1.

8. Click Create.

9. In Create a NAT gateway, click Create.

> Note: Wait until the NAT Gateway Status changes to Running before moving onto the next task.

### 3. Create a custom image for a web server

#### Create a VM

1. In the Cloud Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu icon), click Compute Engine > VM instances.

2. Click Create Instance.

3. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

| Property | Value      |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Name     | webserver  |
| Region   | `Region 1` |
| Zone     | `Zone 1`   |

4. Click OS and storage, and then click Change.

5. Click Show Advanced Configuration.

6. For Deletion rule, select Keep boot disk.

7. Click Select.

#### Customize the VM

1. For webserver, click SSH to launch a terminal and connect.

2. If prompted allow SSH-in-browser to connect to VMs, click Authorize.

3. To install Apache2, run the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apache2
```

4. To start the Apache server, run the following command:

```bash
sudo service apache2 start
```

5. To test the default page for the Apache2 server, run the following command:

```bash
curl localhost
```

The default page for the Apache2 server should be displayed.

#### Set the Apache service to start at boot

The software installation was successful. However, when a new VM is created using this image, the freshly booted VM does not have the Apache web server running. Use the following command to set the Apache service to automatically start on boot. Then test it to make sure it works.

1. In the webserver SSH terminal, set the service to start on boot:

```bash
sudo update-rc.d apache2 enable
```

2. In the Cloud Console, select webserver, and then click More actions [:].

3. Click Reset.

4. In the confirmation dialog, click Reset.

> Note: Reset will stop and reboot the machine. It keeps the same IPs and the same persistent boot disk, but memory is wiped. Therefore, if the Apache service is available after the reset, the update-rc command was successful.

5. Check the server by connecting via SSH to the VM and entering the following command:

```bash
sudo service apache2 status
```

> Note: If you see the Connection via Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy Failed popup, click Retry.

6. The result should show Started The Apache HTTP Server.

#### Prepare the disk to create a custom image

Verify that the boot disk will not be deleted when the instance is deleted.

6. For Signal type, select HTTP load balancing utilization.

7. Enter Target HTTP load balancing utilization to 80.

8. Click Done.

9. Click Initialization period and set to 60 seconds.

> Note: Managed instance groups offer autoscaling capabilities that allow you to automatically add or remove instances from a managed instance group based on increases or decreases in load. Autoscaling helps your applications gracefully handle increases in traffic and reduces cost when the need for resources is lower. You just define the autoscaling policy, and the autoscaler performs automatic scaling based on the measured load.

10. In Autohealing, for health check type `http-health-check`

11. Select http-health-check (TCP)

12. For Initial delay, type 60. This is how long the Instance Group waits after initializing the boot-up of a VM before it tries a health check. You don't want to wait 5 minutes for this during the lab, so you set it to 1 minute.

13. Click Create.

14. Click Confirm in the dialog window.

> Note: Wait a few minutes for the Instance Group to be created before repeating the same procedure for notus-1-mig in Region 2 Click Refresh until the Status changes to Transforming.

> Note: If a warning window appears, or you see a red exclamation mark to the left of the instance group after creation stating There is no backend service attached to the instance group. Ignore this; you will configure the load balancer with a backend service in the next section of the lab.

15. Click Create Instance Group.

16. Specify the following, and leave the remaining settings as their defaults:

| Property                                  | Value                           |
